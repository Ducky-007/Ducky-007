### Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm a data scientist/analyst passionate about solving problems, staying curious and doing whatever is necessary in order to get the job done. I'm a valuable team player because I listen well to others and take on any problems with my full attention and dedication.

As I finish through Bloomtech's data science program, I've gained the tools necessary to solve problems and realizing my potential in being able to help others too. I can't wait to join a dedicated team who cuts no corners, won't rest until the job is done and have some fun along the way!

My Technical Skills:
🐍 Python,
🐼 Pandas,
🥜 Numpy,
🪢 Scikit-Learn,
🪡 SQL,
📈 Matplotlib,
🤖 Machine Learning

- 🌱 I’m currently working on a project analizing the top 10,000 "Books That Everyone Should Read At Least Once" list on Goodreads!
